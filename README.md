# 16-Bit-Booths-Multiplier
Booth's multiplication algorithm is a multiplication algorithm that multiplies two signed binary numbers in two's complement notation.Booth's algorithm can be implemented by repeatedly adding (with ordinary unsigned binary addition) one of two predetermined values A and S to a product P, then performing a rightward arithmetic shift on P.
